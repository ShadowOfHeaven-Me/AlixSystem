#                 PRE-REGISTER                  #
#-----------------------------------------------#

#Config used when an unregistered player has not joined the server yet, but is trying to

#Highly recommended, as it's greatly optimized and prevents one-time connections for unregistered players (which are common in bot attacks)
prevent-first-time-join: true
#Used if the parameter above is set to true to define the maximum number of remembered connections - a connection will be forgotten only when this list's size amount of connections will be made (min of 3, max of 32767)
connection-list-size: 48
#Defines whether an unregistered player should be required to ping the server before joining (can stop primitive bot attacks, offline mode only)

ping-list-size: 48
#Defines how much accounts in total should be a player allowed to have (counted by their ip), set it to 0 or less if you want to disable it
max-total-accounts: 1
#Prevents unregistered players from logging in using a VPN (designed with the main purpose of preventing players bypassing the limit of 'max-total-accounts' by using VPNs, but may also work a bot counter-measurement)
anti-vpn: true

#                   CAPTCHA                    #
#----------------------------------------------#

#Config used when the player is completing the captcha verification (before he's given the ability to register his account)

#Defines whether an unregistered player should be required to complete a captcha before registering (works as a safety measure against a bot attack, offline mode only)
captcha: true
#Defines the visual representation type of the captcha that will be shown to the tested player. Available:
#map - (1.14+) Gives the player a map item with the given captcha (the safest one)
#subtitle - Shows the captcha in a subtitle (mediocre in terms of safety)
#message - Sends a message to the player with the given captcha (mediocre in terms of safety and can be missed by the user)
captcha-visual-type: map
#Available:
#numeric - The captcha is a number between 0 and 9999 (referring to the default captcha length of 4)
#text - The captcha is a four letter text (referring to the default captcha length of 4)
captcha-type: text
#Defines the range (in ASCII) of possible symbols in the text captcha (will not work for non-literal chars & ranges greater than the total of 32767)

#Defines the length of the captcha (min of 1, max of 5)
captcha-length: 5
#Defines whether captcha should be case-sensitive (not recommended, as whether the letters are capital can be sometimes hard to tell)
captcha-case-sensitive: false
#Defines whether the player should be kicked when the entered captcha is incorrect (setting it to false could be risky because of bot attacks)
kick-on-incorrect-captcha: true
#Defines (in seconds) how long should a player allowed to be on the server without completing the captcha test before being kicked out
max-captcha-time: 30


#----------------------------------------------#
#                   LOGIN                      #
#----------------------------------------------#

#Config used when the player is in the login phase, either trying to login in or register

#Defines whether the players who joined with the same ip as before should be automatically logged in (this may cause problems for VPN users)
auto-login: true
#Defines how long (in seconds) should be a player allowed to be on the server not logged in (but with the captcha test completed) (set it to zero or less if you want to disable it, max of 1638)
max-login-time: 75
#Defines whether, if the server is set to offline mode, the players should be required to log in using a set beforehand password
offline-login-requirement: true
#Defines whether the player should be kicked when the entered password is incorrect (setting it to false could be risky because of password crackers)
kick-on-incorrect-password: true
#Defines the way the passwords set by the users will be hashed in by default
# 0 - No hash, not recommended in case of password leaks
# 1 - Mixes characters, very fast but possibly repeatable, stored in a 32-bit integer
# 2 - Uses uuid's bit generation & MD5 hashing, much less repeatable, but in exchange takes more computing time, stored in a 64-bit integer
# 3 - Uses uuid's bit generation & SHA-256 hashing, almost never repeats (no idea if it even ever can repeat), most secure of all the options, but also the heaviest (~1ms of computing time), stored in a 64-bit integer
password-hash-type: 1
#Requires FastLogin, but allows premium users to join without the need of registering or logging in
premium-auto-in: true
#Defines (in milliseconds) the delay between each verification message sent (used for captcha, register and login message reminders, you can set it to 0 or less in order to make the message be sent only once)
verification-reminder-message-delay: 5000

# anvil_password - The user registers/logs in using an anvil rename
# pin - The user have to registers/logs in using a pin gui

# wooden_skull - The built-in wooden skull
# chat_stone_skull - The built-in stone skull with a visible contrast between the darker background and the brighter digit

#Defines the item amount for the pin digits
# <Number> - Any given positive number, up to 64
# digit_equivalent - The item amount will be the exact same as the pin digit
pin-digit-item-amount: 1
#Defines the item amount for the '0' digit in the pin login, as 'digit_equivalent' would result in no item
