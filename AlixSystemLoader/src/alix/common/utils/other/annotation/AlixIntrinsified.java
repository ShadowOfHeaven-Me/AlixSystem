/**
 * This annotation is a purely cosmetic one.
 * It's used to indicate that a certain mechanism or
 * a way of handling has been changed to fit
 * Alix's way of functioning.
 * It's usually used for methods that have been
 * given a faster implementation in Alix, while
 * there already were slower, working implementations.
 * <p>
 * For example translating color codes from & to ยง
 * is normally done with ChatColor.translateAlternateColorCodes,
 * while in Alix it's done with AlixFormatter.translateColors.
 * <p>
 * Another example is the String.split method, which was replaced
 * with a more primitive implementation of AlixUtils.split.
 * The java one accepts all kinds of Strings, while
 * the Alix implementation only accepts non-complex ones.
